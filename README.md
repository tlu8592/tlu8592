### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

## My name is Tony Lu.
My background is in operatic choral and church performance.
I started Full Stack Web Development in 2020 because I enjoy playing typing games. Since that's the case, why not be productive on the computer?
Some of the most exciting things I've been learning about in my new career are building a web app and adding security features to a web app.
Here are a few of the skills I've picked up after completing dozens of projects:
  Front End: React.js, Redux, Hooks, Context API, Yup, Jest, Cypress, Axios, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Netlify
  Back End: Node.js, Express, Knex, SQL, SQLite3, Git CLI, GitHub, VS Code, REST APIs, Debugging, Deployment, Heroku
