### Welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tony Lu.

My background is in operatic choral and church performance. I started React Full Stack Dev in 2020 because I enjoy playing typing games. Since that's the case, why not be productive on the computer? Some of the skills I've picked up after dozens of projects:

<li>Front End: React.js, Redux, Hooks, Context API, Yup, Jest, Cypress, Axios, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Netlify</li>
<li>Back End: Node.js, Express, Knex, SQL, SQLite3, Git CLI, GitHub, VS Code, REST APIs, Debugging, Deployment, Heroku</li>
